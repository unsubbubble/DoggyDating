    h2.center-text Testing & Validation
    br
    p.center-text We did a lot of testing with validation functions and callbacks, as well as manually and with test suites such as Selenium. We mostly used logs and validation functions which would callback with results. We also implemented client side validation to help the user understand better how to correctly enter data without requiring a round trip from the server. With additional time further test functions and better error handling would have been implemented, in particular by having better error reporting in the view context to allow the user to understand and report errors to customer support. Our test prevented errors from corrupting the entire app and are usually contained by validation. This allows functions to ignore invalid parameters and the app to continue functioning. The test results found that the majority of use cases are covered by error checks, however the error reporting is sometimes difficult to understand. A particularly bad example is when entering an invalid date (valid is mm-dd-yyyy) in the Account Registration page. With further time this error message would have been clarified to streamline the users experience.
