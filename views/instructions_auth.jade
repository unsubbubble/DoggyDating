            p Congratulations for creating your DoggyDates account!
            p It's time to get started finding some playdates for your dog!
            br
            p Firstly lets go through a tour of your screen and the features available to you.

                    p Clicking the search icon in the navigation bar takes you to the "Discovery" page. This where the magic happens and our heavily researched matchmaking algorithm does its thing.
                    p If you would like to read more about our matchmaking algorithm you can find details in our "About" section.
                    p The "Discovery" page displays your best match in our system and allows you to "Love" them by clicking the heart icon, and reject them by clicking the cross.
                    p If they "Love" you back you will get a notification next to the heart icon in your navigation bar.

                div.tall-col.col-10
                    p The heart icon in the navigation bar take you to your "Matches". This page lists all your current matches (people you have "Loved" and have "Loved" you back).
                    p As well as listing their details, they also have a direct link to our chat interface if you would like to message them.

                    p The messenger icon on the navigation bar takes you to, you guessed it, the messaging section!
                    p This icon will display the number of unread messages you have. Once you click on the messenger icon you will need to select a contact to message.
                    p If you have no contacts available it is because you do not currently have any matches and might have to up the cuteness in your dog's photo!
                    p If you have a number next to a contact, this shows you the number of unread messages you have from them.
                    p To send a message click on the contacts name, type the message you would like to send in the text box, and press "Send". Easy as that!
